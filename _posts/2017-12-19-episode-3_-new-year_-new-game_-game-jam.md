## Show Notes

The folks at the Stop, Hack, and Roll podcast have announced a New Year, New Game, Game Jam. In this episode, Andrew Cedotal, Dustin Freeman, and I discuss our ideas for submissions to the game jam.

I ended up changing the setting of my game to dystopic underground bunker. The final version I submitted to the jam is [Loyalty Celebration](https://diegeticgames.com/game_files/Loyalty-Celebration.pdf).

Also, I've launched a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/randylubin) for my game designs: [https://www.patreon.com/randylubin](https://www.patreon.com/randylubin)
