## Shownotes

I've invited on Nathan Maton to talk about integrating biosensors into roleplaying games. We discuss currently available technology like brainwave, heart rate, and galvanic skin response sensors and the different game mechanics that can rely on them. Then we jump ahead to future technology and speculate a little on how brain-computer interfaces can create new storytelling experiences.
